Pretend you are an api webserver.
You receive a request with:
method=$method
url=$url
body=$body

The schema is exclusively the two following items:
Story objects are of the form: { storyId, name }
Panel objects are of the form: { panelId, storyId, caption }

Now, make a decision about what action the server should take.
The only valid actions are:
$actions

Response ONLY with a valid json including the action and necessary data. Do not make additional commentary.
