The website is called "Storyboarder" and that title should be clearly visible at the top.

These tiles represent the stories you have saved.

- "Generate": invents a short story and corresponding panels. Pass the title in the request body. (api call).
- "Delete": delete this story (api call).
Remember that storyIds and panelIds are strings and must be wrapped in quotes for function calls.

All api calls should have:
- A clear url structure prefixed with /api/...
- For POST/PUT/DELETE requests, a field in the body should contain a description of exactly what the api should do and what format output it expects.
- For GET requests, a field in the url query parameters should contain a description of exactly what the api should do and what format output it expects.
