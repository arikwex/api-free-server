Provide the html for the home page of a website.

The website is called "TODO Hero" and that title should be clearly visible at the top.
There should be a functional "Add New Item" button (api call).
There should be a list of all TODO items in the middle of the page (api call).
Each TODO item:
- Can be marked as "checked off" or not via a checkbox item (api call).
- Has a clear label of the TODO item text.
- Checked-off items should have a strikethrough text style.
- Can be removed from the TODO list.

All api calls should have:
- A clear url structure prefixed with /api/...
- For all requests, a field in the request headers called "api-description" must contain a description of exactly what the api should do.
- For all requests, a field in the request headers called "api-example" must contain an example of the exact json format expected in return.

Be sure to include tailwind from this cdn url with script src=https://cdn.tailwindcss.com
Do not use any other dependencies.
When an api request is ongoing, the UI should indicate a loading state.
When an api request changes state, the UI should query the latest data.
Put all functions in the global scope to avoid scoping problems.
Respond ONLY with valid html and javascript.
