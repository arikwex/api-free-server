Provide the html for the home page of a website.
The website is called "Storyboarder" and that title should be clearly visible at the top.
There should be a functional "Create New Story" button in blue (api call).
There should be tiles that occupy the middle of the page (api call).
These tiles represent the stories you have saved.
If a tile has panels with captions, those captions should be displayed as a list.
Each tile has the following actions:
- "Edit": opens dialog to change the name (api call).
- "Generate": empty the existing story panels. Invents a totally new short story based on the story name. The result should be a sequence of new panels. (api call).
- "Delete": delete this story (api call).

All api calls should have:
- A clear url structure prefixed with /api/...
- For POST/PUT/DELETE requests, a field in the body should contain a description of exactly what the api should do and what format output it expects.
- For GET requests, a field in the url query parameters should contain a description of exactly what the api should do and what format output it expects.
The descriptions added to requests should provide an example of the exact json format of the response.

The schema of data resources is:
$schema

Be sure to include tailwind from this cdn url with script src=https://cdn.tailwindcss.com
Do not use any other dependencies.
When an api request is ongoing, the UI should indicate a loading state.
When an api request changes state, the UI should query the latest data.
